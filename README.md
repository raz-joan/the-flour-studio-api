# Mod 2: Final Solo Project: The Flour Studio API  

Authored by: [Joan Rasmussen](https://github.com/raz-joan)    

## Overview  
This repo was written as the backend server to fulfill the requirements of the [Showcase project](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html), such that you could make an application based on the data from your chosen API. This API provides data on grains and recipes, as well as, customer reviews, which can be added or deleted.  

## Code Architecture  
The server was written in JavaScript with express.js on Node.js. The routes are all contained in the file `server.js`. Babel and Nanoid were installed as dependencies for syntax and creating unique ids. The data files that are imported and assigned to app.locals are all contained in the data folder.

## Reflections  
I found this project to be a fun challenge and really enjoyed learning some backend concepts. Express.js makes writing the logic quite simple. I also became familiar with using the application Postman in order to easily test the functionality of the dynamic endpoints and the corresponding error-handling.

## Setup Instructions  
1. Clone down this repo to your local machine:
    * `git clone git@github.com:raz-joan/the-flour-studio-api.git`
2. Change into the new directory:
    * `cd the-flour-studio-api`
3. Install the dependencies:
    * `npm install`
4. To fire up the server, run:
    * `node server.js` or `npm run start` or `nodemon server.js`
5. In the browser or postman, use the following endpoints with the base URL: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to retrieve, post, or delete data.

Note: All of these endpoints will return semantic errors if something is wrong with the request.
